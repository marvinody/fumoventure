  - text: "The Collective took notice of this, and pondered it's meaning. Whatever it was, it certainly meant that somebody, or something, was coming! They prepare, warmly.."

  - text: "October 15th. The Collective are at rest, listening to The Great Beacon. But Sanae notices something beneath them.."

  - text: "A box, upon the floor. How unusual."
  - pic: "2.jpg"
  - text: "Sanae tells the others of this unusual item that's resting upon the floor."
  - pic: "3.jpg"
  - text: "Koishi and Shion, the self-imposed leader of the Collective, take a look as well.. Indeed, it is a box."
  - pic: "4.jpg"
  - text: "The Collective gather around it, and determine that it is something that must be opened!"
  - pic: "5.jpg"
  - text: "..So, Shion somehow brandishes a knife. Where did she even keep that thing?"
  - pic: "6.jpg"
  - text: "Poke! The Shion makes the first cut into the box, carefully, carefully.."
  - pic: "7.jpg"
  - text: "Whoops! She gets overzealous, and flings herself off, after opening the box. Thankfully, the dull side of the knife rested against her.. despite the angle it may seem at. Sanae makes sure that Shion is okay."

  - text: "With the knife put away, somehow, Sanae and Shion begin to grab at the edges of the first two flaps, ready to put their weight into pulling this open!"
  - pic: "9.jpg"
  - text: "Huzzah! They hold the flap open, and call over two more members of the Collective to open the next set of flaps."

  - text: "Koishi and Cirno rush in, quickly opening the box fully.. Patchouli notices that a strange object was inside.."
  - pic: "11.jpg"
  - text: "Patchy takes a closer look.. what was this thing?"

  - text: '"Alice''s Fumoventure 2019"? Was this what The Great Beacon was referring to as "She"?'

  - text: "From beneath the mighty rectangular slab.."
  - pic: "14.jpg"
  - text: "A figure of yellow hair approaches! Shion takes notice.."
  - pic: "15.jpg"
  - text: "Quickly helping said soft friend out, Shion rescues the new soft friend out of the box. Patchouli is off-screen, examining the contents of the book.."
  - pic: "16.jpg"
  - text: "The soft Alice, and the self-imposed leader of the Collective, Shion, meet, face to face. It's a soft first impression!"
  - pic: "17.jpg"
  - text: "They accept and welcome her to their Collective, an honorary member!"

  - text: "Thus, Alice's adventure begins! In this chilly city, she'll get to see sights, sounds, and maybe even a few landmarks! Stay tuned!"

  - text: "The Collective have been quiet the last couple of days. It seems they were up to something that wasn't documented. It seems they have built a shrine for The Great Beacon, as it has fallen silent (..probably a potentiometer issue, but that's not important). They wish to scale it it, and rest upon it's elevated view."
  - pic: "n1.jpg"
  - text: "The only issue, though.. is scaling it. It's quite tall, taller than any of the soft ones!"
  - pic: "n2.jpg"
  - text: "Cirno, being the self-proclaimed smartest one, declares that they have an idea to solve this issue! What could she be up to?"
  - pic: "n3.jpg"
  - text: "With a running start, she attempts to scale the monolith in a single leap!.."
  - pic: "n4.jpg"
  - text: "..but, comes falling back down. It's just too much for a single fairy to jump up to."
  - pic: "n5.jpg"
  - text: "Alice, the honorary member of the Collective, proposes a different idea: Teamwork! Let's see what she means.."
  - pic: "n6.jpg"
  - text: "Shion, the leader of the Collective (due to her natural ability to stand without any sort of assistance from her surroundings..), hoists Shion up to her head, to try and reach the edge of the monolith!"
  - pic: "n7.jpg"
  - text: "Alice makes a grasp, and scrambles up, to try and make the rest of the distance.."
  - pic: "n8.jpg"
  - text: "Success! Alice has scaled the massive monolith. The rest of the Collective have decided to try and scale it, thanks to the strong Shion!"

  - text: "First up, is :HeadPatchouli: , up she goes!"
  - pic: "n10.jpg"
  - text: "Next is :koishee: , rising to the top!"
  - pic: "n11.jpg"
  - text: "Then, comes :SanaeBap: , ready to bap her way to the peak!"
  - pic: "n12.jpg"
  - text: "Then, finally, the bashful :CirnoBounce: ."
  - pic: "n13.jpg"
  - text: "But, what's this? Cirno must have realized the value of teamwork, and is helping to get Shion up! Hopefully she can make it.."
  - pic: "n14.jpg"
  - text: "Gotcha! Cirno grabs onto the :shion: and pulls her the rest of the way up."
  - pic: "n15.jpg"
  - text: "The Collective, thanks to the clever idea of Alice, have managed to scale the monolith, where The Great Beacon rests."
  - pic: "n16.jpg"
